# Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of various filtering techniques and the Xin Liu algorithm to calculate the number of people and accuracy in a dataset. The repository consists of four Python files, as well as the datasets used for testing.

## Files Description
1. **advanced_filters.py**:
   - This file contains advanced filtering techniques, designed for more complex data processing needs.
   
2. **basic_filtering.py**:
   - This file includes basic filtering methods, providing simple and essential filtering operations.

3. **xin_algorithm.py**:
   - Implements the functions for the Xin Liu algorithm. This includes:
     - Calculating the number of people.
     - Computing the accuracy based on the algorithm.

4. **main.py**:
   - This is the main script where all methods from the above files are tested. It serves as the entry point for running and evaluating the different filtering techniques and the Xin Liu algorithm.

5. **Datasets**:
   - The repository includes **14 datasets** that are used for testing and validation purposes. These datasets are essential for evaluating the performance of the filtering techniques and the Xin Liu algorithm.

## Usage

To test the filtering techniques and the Xin Liu algorithm, you can run the `main.py` script. **Please note** that you will need to modify the file paths in `main.py` to correctly point to the locations of the datasets.
